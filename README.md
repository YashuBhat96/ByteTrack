# ByteTrack
## Project purpose (Proof-of-concept)
This is one of the first projects which does automatic bite detection in childen. We tried to develop an automatic bite detection system in meal videos in children. We used in-lab meal videos in children (7-9 year olds; total n=345) with 94 children across 4 portion sizes. We used a combination of YOLOV7 (primary) and Faster R-CNN (fallback) for face detection. For bite classification, we used EfficientNet for high-level feature extraction and LSTM for bite vs non-bite classification.
